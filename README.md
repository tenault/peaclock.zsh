## About
__Peaclock__ is a responsive and customizable clock, timer, and stopwatch for the terminal.

The clock output changes depending on the selected mode and view. The mode
determines the clock value, while the view determines how that value is
presented. The clock, timer, and stopwatch modes can be displayed with an ascii,
digital, or binary clock view. The clock can be customized, such as changing
the width, height, colour, padding, and margin. When in auto size mode,
the clock becomes responsive, filling up the full size of the terminal.
The clock can also be set to conform to a specific aspect ratio,
allowing the clock to auto resize without becoming stretched.

### Features
* clock, timer, and stopwatch modes
* ascii, digital, and binary clock views
* display a custom date string
* execute a shell command upon timer completion
* set a specific locale
* set a specific timezone
* auto size the clock to fit the width and height of the terminal
* auto size the clock to conform to a specific aspect ratio
* load settings from a configuration file
* save and load the command history
* fuzzy search the command history
* toggle seconds display
* toggle 12 or 24 hour time format
* use 4-bit, 8-bit, and 24-bit colours to personalize the clock
* use the built-in command prompt or a selection of keybindings to adjust and customize the clock while the program is running

## Usage
View the usage and help output with the `--help` or `-h` flag,
or `./doc/help.txt` to view the help output as a plain text file.

## Binary Clock
The following is a short guide explaining how to read the binary clock.

```
  |   |   | < 8
  | | | | | < 4
| | | | | | < 2
| | | | | | < 1
H H M M S S < Time Digit
```

Each column represents a single digit.
The first two columns are the two hour digits,
the next two are the minute digits,
and the last two are the seconds digits.

The bottom row is the low-order bit,
which makes it worth a value of 1.
The next row up is worth 2, then 4, followed by 8.
Adding up the __on__ bits gives the value of the digit.

## Terminal Compatibility
This program uses raw terminal control sequences to manipulate the terminal,
such as moving the cursor, styling the output text, and clearing the screen.
Although some of the control sequences used may not work as intended on all terminals,
they should work fine on any modern terminal emulator.

## Pre-Build
This section describes what environments this program may run on,
any prior requirements or dependencies needed,
and any third party libraries used.

> #### Important
> Any shell commands using relative paths are expected to be executed in the
> root directory of this repository.

### Environments
* __Linux__ (supported)
* __BSD__ (supported)
* __macOS__ (supported)

### Compilers
* __GCC__ >= 8.0.0 (supported)
* __Clang__ >= 7.0.0 (supported)
* __Apple Clang__ >= 11.0.0 (untested)

### Dependencies
* __CMake__ >= 3.8
* __PThread__
* __ICU__ >= 62.1

### Linked Libraries
* __pthread__ (libpthread) POSIX threads library
* __icuuc__ (libicuuc) part of the ICU library
* __icui18n__ (libicui18n) part of the ICU library

### Included Libraries
* [__Parg__](https://github.com/octobanana/parg):
  for parsing CLI args, modified and included as `./src/ob/parg.hh`

### macOS
Using a new version of __GCC__ or __Clang__ is __required__, as the default
__Apple Clang compiler__ does __not__ support C++17 Standard Library features such as `std::filesystem`.

A new compiler can be installed through a third-party package manager such as __Brew__.
Assuming you have __Brew__ already installed, the following commands should install
the latest __GCC__.

```sh
brew install gcc
brew link gcc
```

The following CMake argument will then need to be appended to the end of the line when running the shell script.
Remember to replace the placeholder `<path-to-g++>` with the canonical path to the new __g++__ compiler binary.

```sh
./RUNME.sh build -- -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER='<path-to-g++>'
```

## Build
The included shell script will build the project in release mode using the `build` subcommand:

```sh
./RUNME.sh build
```

## Install
The included shell script will install the project in release mode using the `install` subcommand:

```sh
./RUNME.sh install
```

## Configuration
Config Directory (DIR): `${HOME}/.peaclock`  
History Directory: `DIR/history`  
Config File: `DIR/config`  
Command History File: `DIR/history/command`

Use `--config=<file>` to override the default config file.  
Use `--config-dir=<dir>` to override the default config directory.

The config directory and config file must be created by the user.

The config file in the config directory must be named `config`.
It is a plain text file that can contain any of the
commands listed in the __Commands__ section of the `--help` output.
Each command must be on its own line. Lines that begin with the
`#` character are treated as comments.

If you want to permanently use a different config directory,
such as `~/.config/peaclock`, add the following line to your shell profile:
```sh
alias peaclock="peaclock --config-dir ~/.config/peaclock"
```

The following shell commands will create the config directory
in the default location and copy over the example config file:
```sh
mkdir -pv ~/.peaclock
cp -uv ./cfg/default ~/.peaclock/config
```

Several config file examples can be found in the `./cfg` directory.
