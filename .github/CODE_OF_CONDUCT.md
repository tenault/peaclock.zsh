# Code of Conduct

zshclock is open-source.
Anyone is free to contribute as much or as little as they want to it, regardless of experience, technical know-how, or coding ability.
Whether it's a simple question in Discussions, or a pull request from a fork that reinvents the wheel and solves fusion, no contribution is unwelcome.

That being said, as the one and only maintainer of zshclock, [@tenault](https://github.com/tenault) reserves the right to accept or deny any contribution for any reason, with or without explanation.
This is to ensure zshclock continues to be zshclock, and doesn't completely fall apart the first time someone tries to commit the entire Bee Movie script.
zshclock _is_ a shell script, after all, and somebody's gotta look out for the poor souls who still haven't seen Jerry Seinfeld's masterpiece and don't want spoilers.

If your contribution is made in good faith and doesn't break anything, then in all likelihood it'll be accepted. In return, all I ask is that you don't, like, be a dick to people.
